# Mugular

Mugular is an e-commerce website for a fake mug selling business. The site features a products page with filters and sorting functionality, as well as a cart and checkout system with card payment option provided by Stripe.

In this project, I have tried to use some new technologies that I'm currently learning- TypeScript and Redux, which was something of a challenge. There's definitely more than a few TS errors in there which I plan to go back and fix, but it has certainly been a wonderful learning experience.

## Stack

- Vite/React, Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Redux for the state management
- Auth0 for the authentication and Stripe for the payment system

## Future changes

There are many changes coming to Mugular, including:

- A page where users can customise their own mugs
- Code refactor- especially when I increase my TypeScript knowledge

Stay tuned!
